<h1>Administrator Guide</h1>
<p class="text-muted">
  Configure pricing data and approve users so the quoting team always has
  current information.
</p>
<p>
  Use this guide alongside the CSV import tools on each admin page. The help
  sections below are linked directly from the form labels to surface the
  context your team needs while editing data.
</p>

<h2 id="rate-tables">Rate tables and zones</h2>
<p>
  The quote engine references multiple rate tables to calculate base charges.
  Keep these tables synchronized so mileage, zone, and weight break logic
  stays accurate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Hotshot and Beyond tables:</strong> Define the mileage brackets,
    weight breaks, and destination zones that drive per-mile, per-pound, and
    fuel-percentage pricing. Align mileage breaks between the two tables so
    quotes switch tiers cleanly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cost and air cost zones:</strong> Map origin/destination
    combinations to margin buckets. Verify that the <code>concat</code>
    identifier stays unique and that each zone has an associated minimum charge
    for air freight.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ZIP zone assignments:</strong> Tie individual ZIP codes to the
    destination zone and note when a location requires beyond mileage. Refresh
    this table whenever carrier coverage shifts.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  After updating any rate table, spot check a few sample quotes to confirm the
  correct tier triggers. Maintain a changelog so operations can trace pricing
  adjustments back to their effective dates.
</p>

<h2 id="accessorials">Accessorial surcharges</h2>
<p>
  Accessorial definitions add flat or percentage-based surcharges to quotes.
  Keep descriptions short and consistent with what appears on customer
  invoices. When adding a new accessorial:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a descriptive name that dispatch and accounting will recognize.</li>
  <li>Set the amount as either a currency value or percentage, then flag
      whether it should be treated as a percentage.</li>
  <li>Review the surcharge in a test quote to verify it applies once and rounds
      the same way invoices do.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Periodically audit the accessorial list to retire outdated fees and confirm
  that margin calculations still meet policy.
</p>

<h2 id="user-approvals">User approval workflow</h2>
<p>
  Administrators control who can access the quote tool and which features they
  can use. Follow these checkpoints when approving a new account:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Verify the requester&apos;s company and contact details match an existing
    partner relationship.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide whether the user needs administrator permissions. Admins can edit
    rate data, approve other users, and manage accessorials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Encourage strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication when the
    account handles sensitive pricing data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Update or deactivate accounts promptly when team members change roles. The
  audit logs on the admin dashboard highlight recent approvals and edits to
  help you trace changes.
