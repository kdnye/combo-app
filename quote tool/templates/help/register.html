<h1>Account Setup Guide</h1>
<p class="text-muted">
  Use this walkthrough to prepare the details our registration form requires and to
  understand what happens after you submit your request.
</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>
  Gather the contact information that appears on your quotes. The review team
  uses these details to verify your identity and configure your user profile.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A business email address that you monitor daily. Shared inboxes can delay
    the confirmation message and password reset requests.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your direct phone number and the company&apos;s main dispatch or office line so
    operations can reach you quickly when loads change.
  </li>
  <li>
    The legal or trade name of your organization. We display this name in the
    header of every quote you send to customers.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="required-fields">Required fields explained</h2>
<p>
  Each field on the registration form matches a section of the user profile.
  Provide accurate data to avoid delays while administrators approve access.
</p>
<dl class="row">
  <dt class="col-sm-4">First and last name</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-8">
    Use the name that should appear in quote signatures. If you commonly go by a
    nickname, include it in parentheses (for example, <em>Jonathan (Jon)</em>).
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-4">Email address</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-8">
    We route confirmation emails and password resets to this address. Double-check
    the spelling before submitting the form to avoid lost messages.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-4">Phone number</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-8">
    Enter a direct line where dispatch or accounting can reach you for urgent
    shipment updates. Mobile numbers are acceptable.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-4">Company name</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-8">
    Provide the legal or DBA name that appears on customer-facing documents. This
    value populates the quote header.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-4">Company phone</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-8">
    Supply the general line customers call for booking and billing questions. If
    your organization has multiple branches, choose the location associated with
    your dispatch team.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-4">Password</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-8">
    Create a unique password that meets the complexity guidance shown on the
    form. Longer passphrases or a mix of upper-case, lower-case, numbers, and
    symbols improve security.
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-4">Human verification</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-8">
    Solve the short math prompt at the bottom of the form. This step keeps bots
    from creating fake accounts and alerts us to repeated failed attempts.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="confirmation-emails">Confirmation emails and next steps</h2>
<p>
  After you click <strong>Register</strong>, the quote tool immediately confirms the
  submission on screen. You&apos;ll also receive a confirmation email summarizing the
  details you provided. If you do not see it within a few minutes, check your spam
  or junk folder and mark the message as safe for future notifications.
</p>
<p>
  Once an administrator finishes the review, you&apos;ll get a second email that
  indicates whether the account is ready to use or if more information is
  required. Employee registrations from a <code>@freightservices.net</code> address are
  flagged for manual approval, so the follow-up email may take slightly longer.
</p>
<p>
  Keep both messages for your records. They include the information you need to
  verify your login and confirm that your profile details are correct.
