<h1>Password Reset Guide</h1>
<p class="text-muted">
  Follow these steps to recover access when you forget your password or suspect that someone else
  has it. The workflow is split between the request page and the secure link that lets you choose a
  replacement password.
</p>

<h2 id="request-link">Request a reset link</h2>
<p>
  While you're signed in, open the <a href="{{ url_for('auth.reset_request') }}">Reset password</a>
  page from the account menu. Because email delivery is paused, the form can only create links for
  the account you are currently using. Signed-out team members should contact an administrator, who
  can verify their identity and provide a temporary link.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click <strong>Generate reset link</strong> to start the process. The
    <code>create_reset_token</code> helper ties the token to your profile and rate-limits repeated
    requests so the system stays responsive.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the token is ready, a <strong>Reset link ready</strong> panel appears with a button that
    opens the password form and a text box containing the one-time token in case you need to switch
    devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tokens expire after one hour and become unusable once the password changes. Generate a new one
    if you miss the window.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-new-password">Set a new password</h2>
<p>
  Click the <strong>Open reset page</strong> button in the panel or copy the token
  into your browser to load the secure
  <code>{{ url_for('auth.reset_with_token', token='example-token') }}</code>
  page&mdash;your token will be unique and only works once. The form shows two
  fields&mdash;one for your new password and one to confirm it. The
  <code>reset_password_with_token</code> helper checks that both fields match and that the token has
  not expired or been used already.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Choose a unique passphrase that is at least 12 characters long. Mixing uppercase, lowercase,
    numbers, and symbols helps protect your account.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the link has expired, return to the
    <a href="{{ url_for('auth.reset_request') }}">request form</a> while signed in to generate a
    fresh token.
  </li>
  <li>
    Successful submissions redirect you to the login screen with a confirmation message so you can
    sign in immediately.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the panel never appears, confirm you are still signed in. Otherwise, reach out to an
    administrator to confirm the account is active and request help.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you think someone else triggered the reset, ignore the message&mdash;unused tokens expire
    automatically, and your existing password remains valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    For urgent access requests, call the operations desk so they can verify your identity and help
    you regain control of the account.
  </li>
</ul>
